#  How do images flow through the software?

- Ignite stores the images (for Level 2 thumbnails) in a directory /images/DSC_6217.jpg relative to the root of the site
    - where is that directory? 
      `/Users/petervandenhamer/Library/Containers/com.vdHamer.Photo-Club-Hub-HTML/Data/Build/images`
    - is that directory filled by copying files from elsewhere?
    - is that directory cleared at the start of a building?
